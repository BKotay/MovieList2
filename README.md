BK MOVIE API

Hello, my name is Blamah Kotay and this is my NODE MOVIE API.

A Node.js-based movie search application that allows users to search for movies using an external API. The app retrieves movie deta such as title and poster, and displays the results on the webpage.

This is built using the following technologies:

Node.js (Server-side JavaScript runtime)
Express.js (Web framework for Node.js)
Fetch API (to call an external movie API)
HTML/CSS (for front-end structure and styling)
Features
Search for movies by name
Displays movie posters and titles returned by the movie API.
Error handling for invalid or empty search queries.
Loading message during the search request.
